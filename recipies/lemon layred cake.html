            <p><li>Add the vanilla then eggs one at a time, scrape down the bowl between additions,<br> and beat until well combined and fluffy.</li></p>
            <p><li>tir the buttermilk and lemon juice together. With the mixer on low speed, add a third of the flour mixture, followed by half of the milk mixture. Continue,<br>
                alternating between the flour and milk, mixing just until combined. Divide the batter among two greased 8-inch cake pans.<br>
                Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, then let cool in the pan for 15 minutes before inverting onto a wire rack to cool completely.</li></p>
            <p><li>To make the frosting, beat the butter and cream cheese together until creamy. Add the lemon zest and beat until light and fluffy before adding the powdered sugar alternating with a little bit of the lemon juice.<br>
                 Beat in the vanilla and continue to beat until smooth and fluffy. Place one layer on a cake stand or serving plate.<br>
                  Top with 1 cup of frosting, spreading smoothly out to the edges.</li></p>
            <p><li>Top with the second cake layer and spread the remaining frosting all over the outside of the cake.<br>
                 Decorate the lemon cake with thin lemon slices or edible flowers, if desired.</li></p>
